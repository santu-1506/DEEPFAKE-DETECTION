# Deepfake Detection Dataset

## Directory Structure:
- data/raw/real/     -> Place authentic human photos here
- data/raw/fake/     -> Place AI-generated deepfake images here
- data/processed/    -> Automatically created clean images go here

## Data Collection Guidelines:
1. Real images: High-quality photos of faces (well-lit, clear)
2. Fake images: AI-generated faces from tools like ThisPersonDoesNotExist
3. Aim for 100-500 images in each category to start
4. Keep images in JPG/PNG format
