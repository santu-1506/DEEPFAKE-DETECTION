### Analytics Database

The system automatically creates an SQLite database at:

```
analytics/analytics.db
```

**Tables Created:**

- `predictions`: Individual prediction logs with metadata
- `system_metrics`: System resource usage over time
- `performance_benchmarks`: Model performance tracking
- `alerts`: Alert history and management

### Monitoring Thresholds

Default alert thresholds (customizable):

```json
{
  "cpu_usage": 80,
  "memory_usage": 80,
  "error_rate": 5,
  "response_time": 2000,
  "accuracy_drop": 10
}
```

## üìà Business Value Metrics

### Revenue Tracking

- **API Call Volume**: Track billable API usage
- **Revenue Per Call**: Calculate earnings at $0.01-0.10 per prediction
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue**: Project based on usage patterns
- **Client Growth**: Monitor enterprise customer adoption

### Fraud Prevention Value

- **High-Confidence Detections**: Track fakes detected with >90% confidence
- **Estimated Fraud Value**: Calculate potential losses prevented
- **False Positive Rate**: Monitor accuracy to maintain trust
- **Detection Trends**: Identify patterns in fraudulent content

### Operational Efficiency

- **Processing Throughput**: Images processed per hour/day
- **Resource Utilization**: Cost per prediction calculation
- **Scalability Metrics**: Performance under different load levels
- **Error Resolution Time**: Time to identify and fix issues

## üîç Advanced Analytics

### Data Export Options

**JSON Export** (for API integration):

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/export/analytics?days=30&format=json"
```

**CSV Export** (for spreadsheet analysis):

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/export/analytics?days=30&format=csv" > analytics.csv
```

### Custom Queries

Access the SQLite database directly for custom analytics:

```sql
-- Top error patterns
SELECT error_message, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM predictions
WHERE success = 0
GROUP BY error_message
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- Daily revenue calculation
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(*) * 0.05 as estimated_revenue,
  COUNT(*) as api_calls
FROM predictions
WHERE success = 1
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp);

-- Performance trends
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  AVG(inference_time_ms) as avg_response_time,
  AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM predictions
WHERE success = 1
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```
